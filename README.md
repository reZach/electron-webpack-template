# electron-webpack-template
A template with electron security best-practices built right in. 

Right now however, the template does not work (issues with webpack). There is an open-thread to the [webpack repo](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/10199) and [electron repo](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21660) in order to hopefully get things settled and working for everyone.

### If you'd like to help
Run the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/reZach/electron-webpack-template.git
cd electron-webpack-template
npm i
npm run prod
```
